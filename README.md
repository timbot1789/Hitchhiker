# Hitchhiker

A zero-dependency javascript web app framework built on Bun. Uses a simple builder API which allows for complex middleware interactions.

Although this project can be used with a package manager, the project is designed to be forked and used as a basis for your your own app. This will provide you with a small, cleanly coded base to expand off of. If you don't like an API, go ahead and change it! If you make an enhancement, feel free to put up a PR.

Thank you to @ishtms and his [Learn Node JS the Hard Way](https://github.com/ishtms/learn-nodejs-hard-way) book for inspiring this project.
