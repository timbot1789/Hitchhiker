# Hitchhiker

A zero-dependency javascript web app framework built on Bun. Uses a simple express-like builder API which allows for complex middleware interactions.

This project is not designed to be used with a package manager. Instead, you should fork the project and use the source code directly in your own project. This will provide you with a small, cleanly coded base to expand off of. If you don't like an API, go ahead and change it! If you make an enhancement, feel free to put up a PR.

Thank you to @ishtms and his [Learn Node JS the Hard Way](https://github.com/ishtms/learn-nodejs-hard-way) book for inspiring this project.

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
